# ElevatorTask
I understood the state of the task, but I couldn't do the algorithm
so that the elevators move automatically and move people in an optimal way.
I searched in  internet but couldn't find a solution to the problem.
So I decided to do the task this way - all actions are controlled by the console.
The program has several commands: adding passengers and elevators; movement of elevators
and adding requests for the movement of passengers to the target floor.
All this is controlled by selecting commands from the console.
